## Future Interest/ Project Ideas
I have a lot of ideas for future projects to create which encompass a wide range of skills, not only front-end developing. Here are some of them:
* Love Letter App - A full-stack application for creating a sending personalized digital love letters as an alternative to mailing love letters. The app aims to give a homemade, personalized feel to digital messages. I plan to develop this using JavaScript, Electron.js, and a database (either MongoDB or Firebase). 
* Conway's Game of Life Simulation - The name is exactly what it is. I am fascinated by Conway's Game of Life, and want to create a simulation to replicate it.
